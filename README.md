# Aruh

An all-in-one android app for academics.

Aruh is a java-based android application that contains all the necessary academic requirements for a college student at one place. This application gets you covered everything from academics, so that you concentrate on skill building and co-curriculars, which are a must for a better career. It's wise to know that academics is not the single requirement for a student. So why waste your time on things that can be handled by a single application in your smartphone? Simplify your academic lifestyle and keep ascending as the name suggests.

The entire application is role-based. Roles can be assigned to class members. Class representative(s) (CR) have the highest role and are responsible to keep the class information up-to-date. The creator of the classroom is a class representative by default. Class representatives are changing every semester. There can be more than one representative too, so the CR role can be assigned to any other member by the existing CR(s). Other roles can be made too to control the access to various features.

**Courses and Attendance** tab keeps you updated with basic information, upcoming assignments, or any work assigned in any course, course plan and materials along with the attendance recorded by the student in that course. Class representative is required to update the attendance and upcoming assignments or relevant links related to the course. They can record the roll numbers of all the absent students to make the work easy. Students can check the work and attendance and can raise issues in the forum section if there are any mistakes.
